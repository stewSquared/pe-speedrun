This is a repo for a live-streamed Project Euler 1-100 "speedrun".

All code is written live on-stream in Scala via Twitch and committed
here. I've previously solved most of these problems previously in
python, but I'm not referencing those solutions, so problem solving is
real-time.

## Running

Load `sbt` and then run a solution `runMain p###`, where `###` is the
zero-padded problem number.

## About Me

I first started solving PE problems 9 years ago, as a learning tool
before entering the software industry. My original repo, for PE user
stewSquared, is [here](https://github.com/stewsquared/project-euler),
and my origbinal PE username is `stewSquared`. Since then, I've become
a professional software developer, using mostly Scala. I have some
free time, so I've decided to revisit these problems to see how long
they take me.
